Welcome to the platform for a professional project manager and senior policy consultant with GIS perspectives, working 10 years for Ministries in China.

I am PhD, major in natural resource management, curious about better policy advising using geospatial tools and data analysis methods.
Excel at ESRI software - ArcGIS Pro, ArcMap, ArcGIS Online, QGIS, WebGIS (Mapbox).
Now I am trying hard for visualization tools and programming, like illustrator, PS, InDesign, Python, R and JavaScript.

Thanks for comments!
