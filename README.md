PhD (2009), major in natural resource management.

Project manager and senior policy consultant with GIS perspective, working 10 years for Ministries in China.

Excel at ESRI software - ArcGIS Pro, ArcMap, ArcGIS Online, QGIS, WebGIS (Mapbox).

Curious about better policy advising using geospatial tools and data analysis methods, trying hard for visualization tools and programming like Python, R and JavaScript.

Thanks for comments!
